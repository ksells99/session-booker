## Session Booker

A full MERN stack application created to allow users to create 'sessions' and add/manage bookings against them - users create their sessions, add their list of members, and then book these members onto the required sessions.

A good example of a use case for this app would be for a breakfast or after school club, where the person running the club can add/remove session bookings and also view a list of members booked onto a particular session.

The application is powered by a MongoDB database, and uses React and Redux for state management. Users can register for, and login to, their own accounts, where they will only see their own sessions and member - authentication is handled via JSON webtokens.

The app is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed here: **https://ksells-session-booker.herokuapp.com/**
